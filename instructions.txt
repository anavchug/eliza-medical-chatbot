Share the Dump File:

Share the dump.sql file with your teammates through a secure channel, such as a file-sharing service or email.
Teammates Run the Import Command:

Team members should have MySQL installed on their machines. They can open a command prompt or terminal.
Navigate to MySQL Bin Directory (Optional):

If MySQL bin directory is not in their system's PATH, they can navigate to the bin directory where MySQL is installed. For example:


cd "C:\Program Files\MySQL\MySQL Server 8.0\bin"
Run the Import Command:

Team members can then use the following command to import the database dump into their local MySQL instance:

mysql -u root -pPassword1 new_database_name < "C:\path\to\dump.sql"

Replace root with their MySQL username.
Replace Password1 with their MySQL password.
Replace new_database_name with the desired name for the new database.
Replace "C:\path\to\dump.sql" with the actual path to the dump.sql file they received.
They will be prompted to enter the password after running this command.

Verify Import:

After the import is complete, they can verify the data in their local MySQL database to ensure it matches the exported data.
